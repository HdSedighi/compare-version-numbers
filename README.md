# Intuition
When comparing two version numbers, the main goal is to iterate through each revision (segment) of both version numbers and compare their integer values. Given the version numbers consist of digits separated by dots (.), we can split the version strings into arrays of individual revisions. For each revision in the version numbers, we can compare their integer values. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, we treat the revision as 0. This allows us to compare the version numbers revision by revision.

# Approach
1. Split the version numbers version1 and version2 by . into arrays of revisions (v1 and v2).
2. Determine the length of the arrays, which would be the maximum of the two arrays' lengths.
3. Iterate through each index from 0 to the determined length:
- For each index, retrieve the revision number from each array. If an array does not have a revision at an index, use 0 as the revision value.
- Convert the revision strings to integers to compare their values.
- Compare the integer values of the revisions. If a revision from version1 is less than a revision from version2, return -1. If a revision from version1 is greater than a revision from version2, return 1.
4. If the loop completes without finding a difference in revisions, return 0, indicating that the two version numbers are equal.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the approach is O(n + m), where n is the length of the version1 string and m is the length of the version2 string. The Split operation takes time proportional to the length of the input string, and the loop iterates through a maximum of the lengths of the two arrays of revisions. In each iteration, the integer parsing and comparison are constant time operations.
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the approach is O(n + m), where n is the length of the version1 string and m is the length of the version2 string. This space is used for storing the split arrays of revisions (v1 and v2).
